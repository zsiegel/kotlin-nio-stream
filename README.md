# Kotlin NIO (Non-Blocking IO)

This is an example project for playing around with NIO and Kotlin.

The master branch contains [tags](https://github.com/zsiegel/kotlin-nio-stream/releases) of the codebase at the end of each stream.

I will be streaming updates to this codebase via [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/zsiegel87)

You can access an archive of the streams on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbsmalhjD-3ZZ4ce5OPFpT-CzL2XXp99m)
